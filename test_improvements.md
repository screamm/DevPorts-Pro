# DevPorts Pro - Improvements Test Report

## Date: 2025-09-30

## Improvements Made

### 1. Port Scanning Performance ‚ö°
- **Before**: Sequential scanning (1 port at a time)
- **After**: Concurrent scanning with 500 worker goroutines
- **Expected Improvement**: 100-500x faster (from ~5 minutes to ~5-15 seconds for 9999 ports)
- **Implementation**: Worker pool pattern with channels

### 2. UI Enhancements üé®
- Updated window size: 1024x768 ‚Üí 1100x800
- Modernized color scheme (cyan/green theme)
- Improved typography with larger title (18px)
- Better status icons (‚ö°‚úì‚úó‚ü≥‚è≥)
- Enhanced button styling with HighImportance
- Optimized column widths for better readability
- Added scan duration display in status
- Improved footer styling

### 3. Process Killing Verification ‚úì
- **Before**: Single check after 500ms
- **After**: Multiple verification attempts with exponential backoff
- **Retries**: Up to 5 attempts with increasing delays (200ms, 400ms, 600ms, 800ms, 1000ms)
- **Better Windows support**: Using `/nh` flag for cleaner output parsing
- **Error dialogs**: Show error popup for failed kills

### 4. Response Time Improvements ‚ö°
- Port timeout: 50ms ‚Üí 100ms (more reliable)
- Refresh delay after kill: 2000ms ‚Üí 1500ms (faster)
- Improved IP address format: "localhost" ‚Üí "127.0.0.1" (faster DNS)

## Testing Checklist

### Port Scanning Tests
- [ ] Application launches successfully
- [ ] Initial scan completes in <30 seconds
- [ ] All active ports are detected
- [ ] Port numbers are sorted correctly
- [ ] Process names are displayed correctly
- [ ] PIDs are accurate
- [ ] Scan duration is displayed in status

### UI Tests
- [ ] Window opens at 1100x800 resolution
- [ ] All UI elements are visible and properly aligned
- [ ] Status messages use new icons (‚ö°‚úì‚úó‚ü≥‚è≥)
- [ ] Colors match new cyan/green theme
- [ ] Table columns are properly sized
- [ ] Buttons are properly styled

### Process Killing Tests
- [ ] Kill button appears only for valid PIDs
- [ ] Confirmation dialog shows correct information
- [ ] Process termination succeeds
- [ ] Verification confirms process is killed
- [ ] Error dialog appears if kill fails
- [ ] Table refreshes automatically after kill
- [ ] Killed process no longer appears in table

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Scan completes in under 30 seconds
- [ ] UI remains responsive during scan
- [ ] No freezing or crashes
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable

### Edge Case Tests
- [ ] Can kill system processes (with admin rights)
- [ ] Handles unknown PIDs gracefully
- [ ] Handles failed kill attempts with proper error messages
- [ ] Auto-refresh works correctly (5 min intervals)
- [ ] Multiple quick refreshes don't cause issues

## Build Information
- **Executable**: devports-pro-improved.exe
- **Size**: 42MB
